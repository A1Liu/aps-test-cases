 * Tips:
 * 1. std::set is ordered, you want std::unordered_set for a hashset
 * 2. Same for maps, std::unordered_map is the hashmap
 * 3. You can multiply numbers by -1 to turn a Min heap inot a max heap
 * 4. #include <algorithm> gets you 90% of the way through most problems;
 * there's some mighty fine wheels in there, so don't reinvent them if you don't
 * have to
